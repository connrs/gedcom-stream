# GEDCOM File
[![Travis CI Test Status](https://travis-ci.org/connrs/gedcom-stream.png)](https://travis-ci.org/connrs/gedcom-stream)

A processor for GEDCOM files. Gedcom is a writable stream that you can pipe data in to. It will emit objects (each one representing an entry from the GEDCOM file) as the stream is piped in.

## Usage

The implementation matches any standard writable stream: Initialise, pipe in a readable stream and use the data, end and error events to handle the output.

    var fs = require('fs'),
        Gedcom = require('gedcom'),
        gedcom = new Gedcom(),
        data = [];

    gedcom.on('data', data.push.bind(data));
    gedcom.on('data', function (data) {
      // Do something with the data, i.e. db.insert(data);
    });
    fs.createReadStream('family.ged').pipe(gedcom);
